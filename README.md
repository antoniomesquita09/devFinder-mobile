## GoFilms

First of all, clone this repository to your machine and go inside the application folder to run a few starter commands.

In the project directory, you can run the commands below to build and run the app in development mode (make sure you have `yarn` and `npm` installed in your machine):

### `npm install expo-cli --global`

Intall `expo-cli` global.

### `yarn`

Builds all the app dependencies.<br />

### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
And it will automatically open [http://localhost:19002/](http://localhost:19002/) tab from expo with the metro bundle.

To see the application running you can scan the QR code with your iphone or android smartphone and it will open the `expo app`, but make sure you already have the app installed in your phone. Or you can run the application on Android emulator or iOS emulator, you can find both options on [http://localhost:19002/](http://localhost:19002/) tab.

To see all the app funcionalities working perfectly you'll also need to run the backend project: [https://github.com/antoniomesquita09/devFinder-backend](https://github.com/antoniomesquita09/devFinder-backend)

Hope you all enjoy it! :)
